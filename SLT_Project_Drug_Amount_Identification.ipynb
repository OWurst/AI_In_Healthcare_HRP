    "# Drug Amount Identification\n",
    "For my HRP, I will be using AI tools to scrape medical notes to identify drug amounts administered to patients. If I can do this successfully, I will use these methods to flag discrepencies between drugs given to patients according to the prescriptions table, and the notes that have been written up on the patients. Flagging discrepencies for closer examination will help hospitals in the following ways:\n",
    "1. More accurately track inventory\n",
    "2. Identify common pain points in data entry\n",
    "3. Build more robust datasets to work with (less bad data)\n",
    "4. Treat patients more effectively (more accurate information on treatment a patient has already received)\n",

      "stents in respiratory failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She\n",
      "did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\n",

      "4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely\n",

      "outpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up\n",

      "did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\n",
      "course, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\n",

      "10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\n",

      "13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle\n",

      "musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\n",

      "the elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was\n",
      "most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\n",
      "as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\n",

    "This is by far the best of the options. It is smart enough to not output a bunch of copies of the same drug unless there is different for frequency or dosage and does a great job, to my eyes, of picking everything up accuracy. Also, there is no reliance on regex and sliding windows, which makes this method far more robust and transferrable to different types of documents and new drugs. Interestingly, the second option added correct information for drugs that weren't even in our list, which does tell me that I need to prompt more carefully, but also shows the model's potential to be generalized to my larger project."
